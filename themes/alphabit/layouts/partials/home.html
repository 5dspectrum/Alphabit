						<h2>ALPHABIT PHILOSOPHY</h2>
						<hr class="redline"/>
						<p>At Alphabit, we believe in the blockchain. We believe in decentralisation. We do not believe in centralised entities and fiat currency systems. It is with that in mind, that our goal is to generate our clients more bitcoin than they started with. Not only that, we do it whilst generating lower volatility than that exhibited by bitcoin itself.  </p>

						<h2>WE OUTPERFORM BITCOIN,<br/>AND WE DO IT WITH LESS RISK.</h2>
						
						<p>We blend investment strategies to improve the efficiency frontier of the fund. That means, we generate higher returns per unit of risk than that of Bitcoin.</p>

						<h3 class="text-center">Risk Warning</h3>
						<p><strong>Important information</strong></p>
						<ol>
							<li>Past performance is not a guide to future performance, nor a reliable indicator of future results or performance. </li>
							<li> The value of investments, and the income or capital entitlement which may derive from them, if any, may go down as well as up and is not guaranteed; therefore, investors may not get back the amount originally invested. </li>
							<li> Unless the performance of an investment meets or exceeds the rate of inflation, the real value of that investment will reduce. </li>
							<li> Changes in economic or political conditions or other factors can substantially and potentially adversely affect the value of investments and, accordingly, the performance and prospects of the investment funds, unit trusts and other funds managed by Alphabit Limited (the "Funds"). </li>
							<li> The price of shares issued by a Fund may fluctuate significantly and investors may not be able to sell their shares at or above the price at which they acquired them. Crypto Currency markets have in the past experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. Any broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of the shares issued by a Fund. </li>
							<li> There can be no guarantee that the investment objective of a Fund will be achieved or provide the returns sought by the Fund. </li>
							<li> Tax legislation and the levels of relief from taxation can change at any time. Any change in the tax status of a Fund or in tax legislation could affect the value of the investments held by the Fund or its ability to provide returns to its investors. </li>
							<li> An investment in a Fund is only suitable for investors who are capable of evaluating the merits and risks of such an investment and who have sufficient resources to be able to bear any losses which may arise from such an investment (which may be equal to the whole amount invested). Such an investment should be regarded as long term in nature and complementary to existing investments in a range of other financial assets and should not form a major part of an investment portfolio. </li>

						<p>Benchmarked to bitcoin, any position held within the fund which is not bitcoin is an active position. Every active position is taken with a view to it generating a higher return than that of simply holding bitcoin. </p>
						<p>Alphabit generates excess returns over beta (bitcoin market return) via a number of different ways. </p>

										<h3>MANUAL TRADING</h3>
										<p>Manual trading is what Alphabit does, day in, day out buying and selling altcoins with a view to generating strong returns. These positions maybe strategic, longer term plays and stay in the portfolio overweight for a prolonged period of time, or may be traded, buy in one day, and sell out the next day in order to capitalize on the favourable volatility of a token relative to bitcoin. </p>

									<h3>ALGORITHMIC TRADING</h3>
									<p>Algo-trading generates alpha for the company broadly through two main avenues. The first is by arbitraging varying prices across various different exchanges.</p>
									<p>Our Algoâ€™s also generate excess returns through market making a specific token, buying and selling at differing prices on one exchange giving volume to the token in question. </p>
